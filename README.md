# Guest List Project

## Description

This JavaScript program allows the user to create and manage a guest list for a dinner party. The program:
- Prompts the user to input the names of people they would like to invite.
- The guest list is limited to 10 people.
- When the user tries to add an 11th person, they are given an option to replace someone on the list.
- Handles responses like "yes" or "no" (case-insensitive) for replacing someone on the list.
- Displays the final guest list with the names separated by commas.

## How to Use
1. Open the `guestList.js` file in a JavaScript environment (e.g., browser console).
2. Run the program and input names when prompted.
3. If adding an 11th person, choose whether to replace someone on the list.
4. The program will output the final guest list.
